## Installation

### Using PHP on your machine

This project requires PHP 8.3+, a MySQL database, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

If you already have PHP installed, you can use `php artisan serve` or [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/valet) paired with an installed version of MySQL, or a tool like [Takeout](https://github.com/tighten/takeout).

1. Copy the .env file and edit the values to suit your environment:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. If you have Composer installed, run `composer install` to install Laravel Sail. Otherwise, install using the following Docker command (see [the docs](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sail#installing-composer-dependencies-for-existing-projects)):
   ```bash
   docker run --rm \
       -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
       -v $(pwd):/opt \
       -w /opt \
       laravelsail/php84-composer:latest \
       composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
   ```

3. Start the containers:

   ```bash
   # Add -d to run in the background
   ./vendor/bin/sail up
   ```

4. Configure the app and build the frontend:

   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
   ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
   ./vendor/bin/sail artisan db:seed
   ./vendor/bin/sail npm install
   ./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev
   ```

The app will be available on http://localhost:[APP_PORT], depending on the `APP_PORT` you specified in your .env file (`80` by default).

A dummy account will be created with the following credentials which can be used to log in and preview the app:  
Email: admin@example.com  
Password: admin

## Building the frontend assets
